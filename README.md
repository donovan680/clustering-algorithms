Clustering or cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning problem.

It is often used as a data analysis technique for discovering interesting patterns in data, such as groups of customers based on their behavior.

There are many clustering algorithms to choose from and no single best clustering algorithm for all cases. Instead, it is a good idea to explore a range of clustering algorithms and different configurations for each algorithm.

The scikit-learn library provides a suite of different clustering algorithms to choose from.

A list of 10 of the more popular algorithms is as follows:

Affinity Propagation
Agglomerative Clustering
BIRCH
DBSCAN
K-Means
Mini-Batch K-Means
Mean Shift
OPTICS
Spectral Clustering
Mixture of Gaussians
